## Project Overview

This is meant to both be a development project and a real publication for nonfiction/fiction, poetry and more. It's built in react using tailwind css. I have invited the writers I know to contriubte what they can and I plan on doing upkeep and building new features as we go. 

## Local Development

Anyone who would like to is ecouraged to clone the repo and use the compenents and structure for their own similar project! I would love if this could be helpful for others with the same idea.
