      Landfills burned. Kittens cried. \n
      The atmosphere was black. Leaving  
      At such a time was a hard decision

      But it was what the age demanded.  
      Food was like diamonds. Trees leafed  
      Once a year. Vultures perched,

      Starved, and toppled over. By then,  
      There were not many of us left, and  
      Us still here ranted all the time

      About what a blunder it all was, how  
      Entertainment stupefied us for eons:  
      “Dumb enough to think they are smart”

      Described Anthropocene Man  
      In one famous Large Language Model’s  
      Poem. Who would have known

      There was only so much stuff  
      On Earth? Apparently no one.  
      That, then, is just about why

      We had to leave, destination  
      Unknown, a dead planet that’s  
      Shrinking to a needlepoint

      Outside the window as I,  
      Looking back, strain to imagine  
      Just what was so good about it.

    title: "THE BALLAD OF A YOUNG MACKEREL",

    Rain murmured on the surface of the sea. A few feet below, mackerel eggs floated in amorphous clumps and rose when swells churned the water. One egg reached the surface and, struck by a drop of rain, burst, freeing the larvae. All around him were spherical eggs, almost identical, save for the different ways the dark shape inside could be coiled. The spheres rolled and pushed against him, impeding his progress. 
    A clump broke apart and the young mackerel wriggled free. Suddenly, he felt beside him other small, slick bodies. He followed them. Though they were only pairs of lenses propelled by a trailing filament, some instinct kept them together as they moved in wonder among the spheres that would unfurl and add to their numbers.
    As his body took shape and became solid, he rarely felt that initial pleasure of being among the others and only the mute fear of being away from them. Wrong to be alone: to have an infinite number of axes on which to orient himself. Wrong not to see the glistening stripes of those other bodies. Wrong not to feel them next to him.
    Never again did he confront those strange spheres: the original mystery on which all others were founded. Swimming through the cold water, especially among the others, was a perpetual rebirth. In every moment the mind was being washed. Those old images were not important, not of any use. And the cold brine of the water was eager to absorb all that vanished from his mind. 
    He chased after and ate tiny, translucent shrimp. Large forms swam around him in silence. He could not distinguish between them. A marlin, a tuna, a seal—only different sizes and manifestations of the same pre-conscious terror. That terror drove to no hiding place. No refuge other than the cold laws of statistics.
    A large, shining form darted into the shoal and swallowed a brother next to him. Its mouth perforated his tail fin. The sensation shot up the nerves to his brain and made him aware of that section of his body. It was wrong. He must change the situation. He responded correctly: his body made frantic sine waves and, together with the shoal, veered away. 
    A full moon. The light came through the black water in broken shafts. The bodies of his brothers and sisters caught this light. Glimmers moved as they moved, incomplete, rippling as the light passed over dark spots in gray-scale iridescence. He did not stop to sleep at night: the fluid dream of his life was unbroken since birth.
    With the details of his brothers and sisters obscured, he perceived only the movement of the whole. They moved like one of the gigantic forms that frightened him. Then it changed, ideas of size having nothing to fix themselves on in the moonlight, and it was as if he was one scale on the body of a sister. 
    He felt himself being pressed tightly against his siblings as if some threat were causing them to shrink together. Only, as they shrank, instead of swimming faster as they normally would, they slowed down and were almost motionless. He wriggled, but he only felt the pressure of the others grow stronger. He began to slide. 
    The forceful rush of water through his gills caused him to vomit the contents of his stomach. It was wrong. As he slid among the teeming bodies, he suddenly found himself still. A mesh pressed into his body, forming a grid of pain unlike anything he had experienced. There was nothing he could do to fight against it.
    Then, finally, relief. The grid separated from his scales and he tumbled freely onto a hard surface. The pressure was gone, but now new pains started. He felt drying and his body’s inability to move through this medium. His body felt the absence of what he had always known before. His nerves fought against it, causing him to spasm and flop. New colors and forms, blurred without the guiding presence of water, reached his eyes.
    By some miracle, he flopped through a rectangular drainage slot. The frightening colors and blinding light resolved with a quick smack of pain as he broke the water's surface. Hesitantly, he swam again, only he did not feel or see others. There were, though, some krill undulating near the surface. Coming out of a stupor, he began to snap at the delicious crustaceans. The sun came through the waves in splinters. For those moments eating the krill, he was freed from wanting or fearing anything. 
    He was grasped painfully on both sides and forced deeper underwater. The sheath of air that had wrapped the gull disintegrated into bubbles. With a pulsing motion of wings, the joined pair burst through the mirrored surface. His eyes looked into the heart of light. Then, his seared vision made phantom stains of color play on the empty sweep of ocean. 
    The gull turned and other birds reeled above the fishing vessel and dove after the fish. One was stopped by a man in overalls waving his arms. It beat its wings and hovered there a moment.
    With a quick jerk of its head, the gull terminated this scene. The mackerel descended down the throat and reached the bile in the stomach. The pressure mounted and bile stung especially his gills, his eyes, and where the bird’s beak had pierced his side. Death was not overly patient. Pain, which had been a good instinct and had not misled him before, fired through the final nerve.

    title: "Tableau From an Outcropping, Yosemite Pt., 6,939 ft., Midday",
    author: "Henry Romain",

    content: `At the horizon,
    The plush round clouds behind the serrated mountain range look like rolling snow-capped hills.
    I, immobilized in exegesis, look.

    A lacy Mandelbrotesque cloud radiates 
    Radiciform tendrils & veins like aqueous 
    Airborne mycelia floating in an austere blue sky.
    Yosemite Falls drops off here to my left:
    The water dissipates into mist midair, the haze 
    Beading on my inscrutable expression. 

    A crow leaps off the cliff
    And soars in an arcing loop-de-loop,
    Splaying glossy obsidian feathers
    Then perching on its shining black 
    Raptorial talons on a rock next to me. 

    The crow blankly stares through me with
    An eye whose black pupil and yellow iris
    Form a tiny solar eclipse. It blinks.

    The soft, cottony clouds at about 10 o’clock look 
    Like the smeared daubs of a thinly bristled brush sopping 
    With a little too much pinkish-whitish paint.
    The blue behind the clouds still austere.
    A brown-headed cowbird’s call makes the same sound 
    That water tricking over pebbles & leaves & moss & dirt I passed on my way up here makes.
    My instinct is to disbelieve. I don’t.

    There’s wind, but not much.

    A curving fragment of Half Dome obfuscated by the rock face of the wall I’m on top of
    (With whole serpents of sediment crisscrossing the face)
    Looks like the beak of a bird 
    (And the head of the bird is the mountain & forest below it)
    Or a waxing crescent.


    To my right, a wall: a geologic kaleidoscope of acute 
    Contours defining grey in every tint & tone,
    Bursting with new ideas of what grey could be, 
    And trees are growing on ledges here & there.

    Oscillating through the valley below like curly hair:
    The army green of the Merced River’s mossy floor,
    With the prairie around it cornsilk and hay.
    The nuclear green of the moss growing way up
    At the top of the tree behind me seems to glow. 
    The trees in the shadow of the valley are viridian.
    The pine needles are slivers of emerald.

    The crow flies in an ouroboros, landing where it lept from. It blinks.

    From here, there is such a sense that—look—
    Here are the trees—here’s the mushrooms & 
    Lichens & grass & pinecones—& then here’s all 
    The people with their little bodies & nails 
    & buildings, cars, tents, underwear, cell 
    Phones, & here is a valley of ultimately 
    Indifferent things that are intertwined together 
    In ecological processes.

    It is awfully quiet up here.

    This scene is the sort that if you don’t see every once in a while,
    You might see everyday human life as dramatic and large and significant and relevant—
    Houses would seem large—
    Buildings would seem huge—
    Political structures would be a given—
    Industrialization and capitalism would be givens—
    Cars would be givens laptops would be givens—
    Education and money and careers would all be givens—
    You might think you’re at the center of the world—
    You might think nothing about what goes on in places where you aren’t.




    And what is this then, on the other side of the valley?
    A mountain? 
    A ginormous & rigidly malleable geologic wave of rock & dirt & leaves & life crashing through existence at a rate of procession that makes my mammalian life feel overwhelmingly fast?
    To it, humanity will pass with the illusory significance of a false sneeze’s inhalation.
    To it, the sun rising and setting every day is as unnoticeable as heartbeats.
    To it, what is time?
    Seconds? Minutes? Hours? Years?
    It’s ridiculous—what are all the dials and numbers referring to?
    Do things really change?
    Do we exist in one long instant?
    Does the mountain care that they built a Starbucks in the valley?

    As I stir from where I sat for so long looking off the outcropping,
    I realize that I hardly understand what I’ve been looking at at all.
    I realize that I hardly understand anything.
    Oh well, I think.

    The crow does another loop. It blinks.

We talked for over an hour before it was time to hang up the phone.",
