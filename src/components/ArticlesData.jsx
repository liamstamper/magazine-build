      Landfills burned. Kittens cried. \n
      The atmosphere was black. Leaving  
      At such a time was a hard decision

      But it was what the age demanded.  
      Food was like diamonds. Trees leafed  
      Once a year. Vultures perched,

      Starved, and toppled over. By then,  
      There were not many of us left, and  
      Us still here ranted all the time

      About what a blunder it all was, how  
      Entertainment stupefied us for eons:  
      “Dumb enough to think they are smart”

      Described Anthropocene Man  
      In one famous Large Language Model’s  
      Poem. Who would have known

      There was only so much stuff  
      On Earth? Apparently no one.  
      That, then, is just about why

      We had to leave, destination  
      Unknown, a dead planet that’s  
      Shrinking to a needlepoint

      Outside the window as I,  
      Looking back, strain to imagine  
      Just what was so good about it.

Thought it was Brekkus. She told me about an “executive physical, only for CEO’s or people high up in business” and about something Sean Hannity said after he got arrested “you have no idea how tame things are compared to what’s about to come.” I also quoted Scott, on two occasions:“I’m old school- outta a job on Sunday, find one by Tuesday”.”I like to have something to look at when I’m done with my work” I also told her about how the Clouds and Sky and grass at the job site looks like Sims. We talked for over an hour before it was time to hang up the phone.",
